			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Embrace confusion.  It means your brain has recognized that something different is happening...your brain is now at attention.</p>

			<p>Picture yourself standing at the side of a pool...now jump in!</p>

			<h4>Trust in the resources you already have under your belt.</h4>
			<p>You don't have to know everything (of course).  Just start with what you do know, including the books, article, websites you know about (like Google!) and have at it.</p>

			<p>Oh, and by the way, you probably have made a few friends that could probably help you out as well.</p>
